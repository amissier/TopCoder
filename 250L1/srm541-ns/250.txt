Problem Statement
    
Consider the following function: f(X) = Waai + X + Akari + X + Daisuki Here, X is a string and + denotes string concatenation. Waai, Akari and Daisuki are constant non-empty strings.
 
You are given a string S. Compute and return the number of different tuples (Waai,Akari,Daisuki,X) such that f(X) equals S.
Definition
    
Class:
AkariDaisukiDiv2
Method:
countTuples
Parameters:
string
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int countTuples(string S)
(be sure your method is public)
Limits
    
Time limit (s):
2.000
Memory limit (MB):
64
Notes
-
Two tuples (A,B,C,D) and (E,F,G,H) are considered equal if and only if A=E, B=F, C=G, and D=H.
Constraints
-
S will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-
Each character of S will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').
Examples
0)

    
"topcoderdivtwo"
Returns: 2
The possible tuples of (Waai, Akari, Daisuki, X) are the following ones:
("t", "pc", "derdivtwo", "o")
("topco", "er", "ivtwo", "d")
("topc", "derdivtw", "", "o") is not allowed since Daisuki is empty.
