Problem Statement
    
We have a collection of strings, and we want to right justify them. Given a vector <string> text, your task is to return a vector <string> containing the same strings, right justified, in the same order as they appear in text.
The returned strings should be padded on the left with space characters so that they are all the same length as the longest string in textIn.

{"JOHN","JAKE","ALAN","BLUE"}
Returns: {"JOHN", "JAKE", "ALAN", "BLUE" }
No padding is necessary since they all contain the same number of characters.

{"LONGEST","A","LONGER","SHORT"}
Returns: {"LONGEST", "      A", " LONGER", "  SHORT" }
