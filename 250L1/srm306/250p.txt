Problem Statement
    
We have a sorting machine that works on a list of distinct numbers. This machine only has one instruction named MOVE that takes one element of the list as a parameter. The MOVE instruction removes the element from the list and then appends it to the end of the remaining list.
For example, the sequence {19,7,8,25} can be sorted in ascending order using 2 instructions: MOVE 19, to get {7,8,25,19} MOVE 25, to get {7,8,19,25}
You will be given a vector <int> a containing a list of distinct numbers. Return the minimum number of instructions required to sort the list in ascending order.

Examples
0)

    
{19,7,8,25}
Returns: 2
The example from the problem statement.
1)

    
{1,2,3,4,5}
Returns: 0
This list is already sorted, so no instructions are needed.
2)

    
{1000,-1000,0}
Returns: 1
This list can be sorted with a single instruction: MOVE 1000.
3)

    
{1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,2}
Returns: 7

4)

    
{-2, -8, 9, 0}
Returns: 3

5)

    
{976, -946, -824, 680, -644, -95, 128, -892, 816, -263,
 -592, -669, 887, 447, -653, -759, 572, 171, 635, 98,
 -904, 78, 143, -416, -40, -846, 784, -702, -738, -858,
 582, 603, -535, 529, 84, -964, 934, 36, 783}
