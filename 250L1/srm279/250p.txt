Problem Statement
    
A sentence is called dancing if its first letter is uppercase and the case of each subsequent letter is the opposite of the previous letter. Spaces should be ignored when determining the case of a letter. For example, "A b Cd" is a dancing sentence because the first letter ('A') is uppercase, the next letter ('b') is lowercase, the next letter ('C') is uppercase, and the next letter ('d') is lowercase.
You will be given a string sentence. Turn the sentence into a dancing sentence by changing the cases of the letters where necessary. All spaces in the original sentence must be preserved.
