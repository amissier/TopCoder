Problem Statement
    
Let N1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 1000} (the set of all positive integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive).
Delete every second number in N1. The result is N2 = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, ..., 999}.
Delete every third number in N2. The result is N3 = {1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 21, 25, ..., 999}.
Delete every fourth number in N3. The result is N4 = {1, 3, 7, 13, 15, 19, 25, 27, ...}.
...
Delete every tenth number in N9. The result is N10. Find and return the n-th element of sequence N10, where n is a 1-based index.
