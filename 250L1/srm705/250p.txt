Problem Statement
    
Fox Ciel just used the command "sudo" (super-user do) to gain administrative privileges in the UNIX-based operating system on her computer. She now wants to install several new programs. Each program has some dependencies: in addition to the program, the package manager has to install some libraries used by the program. The package repository contains exactly 1000 libraries. For simplicity, we will number them from 1 to 1000, inclusive. You are given the information about the dependencies of the programs Fox Ciel wants to install. More precisely, you are given the vector <int>s A and B, both containing the same number of elements. For each valid i, one of the programs needs all libraries that have numbers between A[i] and B[i], inclusive. Note that the programs may have overlapping dependences: multiple programs may require the same library to be installed. Of course, in such cases it is sufficient to install such a library once. Calculate and return the total number of libraries that need to be installed.
Definition
    
Class:
SuperUserDo
Method:
install
Parameters:
vector <int>, vector <int>
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int install(vector <int> A, vector <int> B)
(be sure your method is public)
Limits
    
Time limit (s):
2.000
Memory limit (MB):
256
Constraints
-
A will contain between 1 and 100 elements inclusive.
-
B will contain the same number of elements as A.
-
Each element of A will be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
-
The i-th element of B will be between A[i] and 1000 inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
{1}
{10}
Returns: 10
Only libraries 1 to 10 must be installed, so the answer is 10.
1)

    
{1,101}
{10,110}
Returns: 20

2)

    
{1}
{1000}
Returns: 1000

3)

    
{1,2,3,4,5}
{6,7,8,9,10}
Returns: 10
In this test case the dependencies have non-empty intersections. One program needs libraries from 1 to 6, another program needs libraries from 2 to 7, and so on. In order to satisfy all dependencies, the package manager will install libraries numbered from 1 to 10, inclusive. Hence, the total number of installed libraries is 10.
4)

    
{1,1}
{1,1}
Returns: 1
