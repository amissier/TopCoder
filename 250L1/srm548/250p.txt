Problem Statement
    
King Dengklek received a container full of ducks as his birthday gift from his loyal subjects. Each duck is of a specific type, represented by an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. He was told that the container contains the same number of ducks of each type that is present in the container.  King Dengklek wants to guess the total number of ducks in the container. He removed some of the ducks from the container and examined their types. These types are given in vector <int> duckTypes, where duckTypes[i] is the type of the i-th duck (0-based index) King Dengklek picked.  Compute and return the total number of ducks in the container in the beginning (before King Dengklek removed some of them). If there are multiple possibilities, return the smallest one.
