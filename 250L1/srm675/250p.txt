Problem Statement
    
Your task is to write a calculator that will convert between four different length units: inches (in), feet (ft), yards (yd), and miles (mi).  The conversions between these units:
1 ft = 12 in
1 yd = 3 ft
1 mi = 1760 yd
You are given an int amount and strings fromUnit and toUnit. Compute and return the amount of toUnits that corresponds to amount fromUnits. (For example, if amount=41, fromUnit="mi", and toUnit="in", you are supposed to compute the number of inches in 41 miles.) Note that the result will not necessarily be an integer.

1
"mi"
"ft"
Returns: 5280.0
We are asked to convert 1 mile into feet. From the information in the statement we know that 1 mi = 1760 yd = (1760 * 3) ft = 5280 ft.
1)

    
1
"ft"
"mi"
Returns: 1.893939393939394E-4
Here we have 1 ft = 1/5280 mi, which is approximately 0.000189394 miles.
2)

    
123
"ft"
"yd"
Returns: 41.0

3)

    
1000
"mi"
"in"
Returns: 6.336E7

4)

    
1
"in"
"mi"
Returns: 1.5782828282828283E-5

5)

    
47
"mi"
"mi"
Returns: 47.0
