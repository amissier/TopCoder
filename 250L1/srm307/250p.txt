Each boot has some integer size, and a left and right boot will form a proper pair if they have equal sizes. Each boot can only belong to a single pair.

You are given a int[] left and a int[] right containing the sizes of the left boots and right boots, respectively. Return the least number of boots that must be exchanged.
