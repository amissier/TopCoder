Problem Statement
    
A positive integer is called a prime if it has exactly two distinct positive integer divisors: 1 and itself. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...  A positive integer is called a palindrome if its base-10 representation reads the same forwards and backwards. Some palindromes: 2, 77, 101, 33333, 12344321.  A positive integer is called a palindromic prime if it is both a palindrome and a prime.  You are given two ints: L and R. Compute and return the number of palindromic primes between L and R, inclusive.
