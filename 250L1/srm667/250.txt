Problem Statement
    
You are given two distinct points A and B in the two-dimensional plane. Your task is to find any point C with the following properties:
C is different from A and B.
Each coordinate of C is an integer between -100 and 100, inclusive.
The distance between A and C is strictly greater than the distance between B and C.
You are given four ints: x1, y1, x2, and y2. Point A has coordinates (x1,y1) and point B has coordinates (x2,y2). Find the coordinates (x3,y3) of one possible point C with the above properties. Return these coordinates as a vector <int> with two elements: element 0 is x3 and element 1 is y3. In other words, return the vector <int> {x3,y3}.
For the constraints given below it is guaranteed that a valid point C always exists. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

Notes
-
In this problem we consider the standard Euclidean distance. Formally, the distance between points (xi,yi) and (xj,yj) is defined as sqrt( (xi-xj)^2 + (yi-yj)^2 ).
Constraints
-
x1,y1,x2,y2 will be between -50 and 50, inclusive.
-
(x1,y1) will be different from (x2,y2).

Returns: {8, 48 }
In this example, point A is at (-1,0) and point B is at (1,0). Almost any point with a positive x-coordinate will be a valid answer. For example, your program can also return {100,100}, {2,0}, or {9,-100}. Note that you cannot return {1,0} because point C must not be the same as point B.
