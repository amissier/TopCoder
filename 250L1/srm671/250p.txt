Problem Statement
    
Limak is a little polar bear. Today he found two things in the snow: a bucket of blue paint and a white rectangular grid with W times H square cells.
 
Limak is going to paint some (possibly even all) cells blue. He wants to do it in such a way that the blue cells will form a completely filled blue rectangle. He has enough paint for M cells. What is the largest possible area of a blue rectangle he can paint?

Limak has a grid that is W = 3 cells wide and H = 5 cells tall. He doesn't have enough paint to color all 15 cells. He also cannot color just 14 or 13 cells in a way that would produce a blue rectangle. The best he can do is to color four consecutive rows blue. This will produce a blue rectangle. Its area is 12 squares.
