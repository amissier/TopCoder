Problem Statement
    
A lucky number is a positive integer consisting of only the digits 4 and 7.
 
Given an int a, return an int b strictly greater than a, such that a XOR b is a lucky number. (See Notes for the definition of XOR.) The number b should be in the range 1 to 100, inclusive. If such a number does not exist, return -1. If there are multiple such b, you may return any of them.

Notes
-
XOR is the bitwise exclusive-or operation. To compute the value of P XOR Q, we first write P and Q in binary. Then, each bit of the result is computed by applying XOR to the corresponding bits of the two numbers, using the rules 0 XOR 0 = 0, 0 XOR 1 = 1, 1 XOR 0 = 1, and 1 XOR 1 = 0.
-
For example, let's compute 21 XOR 6. In binary these two numbers are 10101 and 00110, hence their XOR is 10011 in binary, which is 19 in decimal.

Constraints
-
a is between 1 and 100, inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
4
Returns: 40
4 XOR 40 = 44, 44 is a lucky number.
1)

    
19
Returns: 20
19 XOR 20 = 7
2)

    
88
Returns: 92
88 XOR 92 = 4
3)

    
36
Returns: -1
