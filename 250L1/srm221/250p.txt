Problem Statement
    
You will be given a string str consisting of lowercase letters. You will return a vector <string> containing elements x and y in that order. The returned strings x and y must satisfy:
1) The string xy (x with y concatenated on the end) must equal str.
2) The number of a's in x must equal the number of b's in y.
3) If multiple solutions are possible, use the one that maximizes the length of x.
See the examples for further clarifications.

Examples
0)

    
"aaabbb"
Returns: { "aaa",  "bbb" }
Here we can split str right down the center.
1)

    
"bbbaaa"
Returns: { "bbb",  "aaa" }
Again the center works.
2)

    
"bbbbbb"
Returns: { "bbbbbb",  "" }
y can be empty.
3)

    
"aaaaaa"
Returns: { "",  "aaaaaa" }
x can be empty.
4)

    
"abjlkbjalkbjaljsbljbalb"
Returns: { "abjlkbjalkbjaljs",  "bljbalb" }
Make sure to maximize the length of x.
