Problem Statement
    
A teacher has graded a test, and you are given a vector <int> scores representing each student's raw score on the test. The teacher wants to convert the scores into grades such that a raw score of 0 receives a grade of 0, and the highest raw score achieved by any student receives a grade of 100. All other scores in between are calculated proportionally, always rounded down. You are to return a vector <int> (with the same number of elements as scores) containing the calculated grade for each student. Element i of the return should be the grade for scores[i].

Examples
0)

    
{15, 27, 8, 33, 19, 50}
Returns: {30, 54, 16, 66, 38, 100 }
Since the highest score is a 50, which gets scaled to a grade of 100, everyone's grade is exactly twice their raw score.
1)

    
{0, 0, 0, 3}
Returns: {0, 0, 0, 100 }
All but one person did poorly on this test.
2)

    
{67, 89, 72, 100, 95, 88}
Returns: {67, 89, 72, 100, 95, 88 }
With a highest score of 100, the grade is exactly the raw score.
3)

    
{1234, 3483, 234, 5738, 3421, 5832, 4433}
Returns: {21, 59, 4, 98, 58, 100, 76 }

4)

    
{8765}
Returns: {100 }
