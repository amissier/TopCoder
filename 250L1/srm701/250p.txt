Problem Statement
    
We say that a string S is a square if it has the form TT, where T is some non-empty string. In other words, a square is a string that is a concatenation of two copies of the same non-empty string. For example, the strings "aa", "bbbb", and "beriberi" are squares.

A string is called square-free if none of its substrings is a square. For example, the string "abca" is square-free. (The substrings of this string are the strings "a", "b", "c", "a", "ab", "bc", "ca", "abc", "bca", and "abca". None of these strings is a square.)

You are given a string s. Return "square-free" if s is square-free. Otherwise, return "not square-free". Note that the return value is case-sensitive.

Examples
0)

    
"bobo"
Returns: "not square-free"
"bobo" = T + T, where T = "bo", so it is not square-free.
1)

    
"apple"
Returns: "not square-free"
Substring "pp" is a square.
2)

    
"pen"
Returns: "square-free"
"pen" does not contain any substrings that are squares.
3)

    
"aydyamrbnauhftmphyrooyq"
