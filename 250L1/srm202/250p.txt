Problem Statement
    
A letter-string is composed of letters ('A'-'Z','a'-'z') and dashes ('-'). The length of a letter-string is the number of characters in it not including dashes (in other words, the number of letters in the string). Given a list of letter-strings you will return the sum of their lengths.  Create a class LetterStrings that contains the method sum, which takes a vector <string>, s, and returns an int representing the sum of the lengths of the given letter-strings.
