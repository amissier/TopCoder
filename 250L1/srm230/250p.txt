Problem Statement
    
Using mathematical induction it is possible to prove the following inequality when n>1:
	s = 13 + 23 + ... + (n-1)3 < n4/4 < 13 + 23 + ... + n3 = S
Given n return (S+s)/2 - n4/4 as a vector <int> with 2 elements. Elements 0 and 1 denote the numerator and denominator of the return value, respectively, when written in least terms (reduced).

Examples
0)

    
2
Returns: { 1,  1 }
We have
s = 1^3 = 1
S = 1^3 + 2^3 = 9
(S+s)/2 = (1+9)/2 = 5
n^4/4 = 16/4 = 4 
Since 5-4 = 1, we return the fraction 1/1.
1)

    
3
Returns: { 9,  4 }
We have
s = 1^3 + 2^3 = 9
S = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 36
(S+s)/2 = 45/2
n^4/4 = 81/4
We return the fraction 9/4.
2)

    
100
Returns: { 2500,  1 }
Largest case.
